    "# The Transportation Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "In the dynamic environment of fashion retail, optimizing transportation logistics emerges as a strategy for enhancing efficiency and reducing costs.   \n",
    "The transportation problem focuses on minimizing costs and itinerary time for two distinct groups involved in showroom appointments: buyers and salespeople.     \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightyellow;\">Buyers</span> from prominent retail companies navigate through the city to attend 6-8 meetings daily across various locations during the fashion week season. Their primary objectives are to:\n",
    "1. streamline their routes effectively;\n",
    "2. adjust in real-time to traffic; \n",
    "3. strategically cluster meetings within proximate areas to maximize productivity.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<span style=\"color:lightyellow;\">Salespeople</span> representing elite brands must:\n",
    "1. efficiently calculate travel times\n",
    "2. adapt to unforeseen schedule changes due to external events e.g. cancellations\n",
    "3. organize their meetings to optimize their daily schedule, which translates into reducing operational costs.   \n",
    "\n",
    "By addressing these tailored needs through refined transportation strategies, companies can significantly bolster profitability and operational efficacy.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Algorithm Rationale\n",
    "The rationale behind the development of the algorithm begins with the reducibility theorem and the foundational concept of the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP), where the objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits a set of locations exactly once and returns to the origin point. Extending this problem to accommodate scenarios where there are multiple buyers, each responsible for covering distinct sets of showrooms without overlap with their colleagues, the problem evolves into the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem (mTSP). This adaptation distributes the workload among several agents, thereby complicating the route optimization process due to the introduction of parallel operational constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "Further complexity is introduced with the integration of specific time windows for each showroom, turning the problem into the Multiple Traveling Salesmen Problem with Time Windows (mTSPTW). Each showroom, treated as a node in the problem, has an associated single time window characterized by a predefined opening and closing time. The algorithm must, therefore, not only determine the optimal route for each buyer to minimize travel time and distance but also synchronize these routes with the operational schedules of the showrooms. This synchronization ensures that each buyer arrives at each showroom within the permissible time window, making the problem both a routing and a scheduling challenge. The inclusion of time windows adds a layer of temporal constraints that requires the algorithm to balance between spatial efficiency and time-specific feasibility, thus significantly enhancing the complexity and practical relevance of the solution.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Construction Hypothesis \n",
    "The introduction of the following set of hypotheses is strategically aligned with the goal of optimizing the transportation logistics in the context of fashion retail showroom visits, where efficiency and cost reduction are paramount. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. A list of brands' showroom addresses is provided, from which the travel costs i.e. average travel time can be retrieved\n",
    "2. Being employees paid by hour, the unit cost of travelling i.e. distance would coincide with the unit cost of waiting, hence this reduces to the Makespan Problem with Time Window. Therefore, the ultimate objective would be just to minimize the tour duration. \n",
    "3. Buyers depart from the same starting point as their colleagues', which is the retail company they work for i.e. depot.\n",
    "4. The TSPTW at hand is stated to be symmetric, setting $t_{ij} = t_{ji}$. Hence, arcs in the complete graph [Subsection *Index Sets* of *Notations*] will be undirected.\n",
    "5. Brands' showrooms are considered to be non-stop i.e. an only time window will be associated to each node. \n",
    "6. Time to visit a brand showroom is measured based a worst-case scenario fashion, in order to get covered as many scenarios as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Notations\n",
    "### 1. Index Sets\n",
    "Let $m$ be the number of buyers within the same retail company, $n$ the number of brands’ showrooms and $G = \\left ( V, A \\right )$ a complete graph, such that:\n",
    "- $V = \\left \\{ 0, 1, .., n \\right \\}$ is the set of the nodes i.e. brands’ showrooms;\n",
    "- Node 0 is the Depot;\n",
    "- $A = \\left \\{ \\left ( i, j \\right )| i\\neq j, j\\in V \\right \\}$ is the set of undirected arcs [$4^{th}$ hypothesys in Section *'Construction Hypothesis'*]. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Parameters\n",
    "- $t_{ij}$ is the travel time from the $i^{th}$ showroom to the $j^{th}$ [$4^{th}$ hypothesys in Section *'Construction Hypothesis'*];\n",
    "- $d_{i}$ is the meeting duration at the $i^{th}$ showroom [$6^{th}$ hypothesys in Section *'Construction Hypothesis'*];\n",
    "- $a_{i}$ is the earliest possible visit to the $i^{th}$ showroom i.e. opening hour during its working dates;\n",
    "- $b_{i}$ is the latest possible visit to the $i^{th}$ showroom i.e. closing hour subtracted by its meetiong duration, during working dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, $\\left [a_{i}, b_{i} \\right]$ consists in the time window related to node $i$ [$5^{th}$ hypothesys in Section *Construction Hypothesis*].\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Decision Variables\n",
    "- $t_{ik}$ is the meeting time the $k^{th}$ salesperson shows up at the $i^{th}$ showroom; \n",

    "## Live Traffic and Cancellations Handling\n",
    "1. Adopted Method - Google Maps Cloud API  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In addressing the dynamic challenges of the Multiple Travelling Salesmen Problem with Time Windows (MTSPTW), this work incorporates of Google Maps Cloud API. This API provides real-time traffic data and information on route cancellations, which significantly enhances the resolution of the live traffic issues faced in mTSPTW. By dynamically updating the travel times between nodes based on current traffic conditions and immediately adjusting the routes in response to cancellations, this solution remains adaptive and efficient in real-time operational contexts.  \n",
    "\n",
    "2. Reinforcement Learning  \n",
    "\n",
    "    In this approach, the environment is defined by the cities, roads, traffic states and time windows, with salesmen serving as agents. Each agent's actions (choosing routes between cities) result in rewards (minimized travel time and penalties for time window breaches). A model-based RL can be employed where a simulation of the environment incorporates live data updates from the Google Maps API, allowing the RL agent to learn and refine policies that **anticipate** and **react to changes** in traffic patterns and route availability. This method leverages techniques like Q-learning or Policy Gradient to iteratively improve the decision-making process, thus enhancing route optimization continuously.  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Genetic Algorithms  \n",
    "\n",
    "    Genetic Algorithms (GAs), on the other hand, provide a **heuristic method** to explore a vast solution space through processes mirroring natural selection, including crossover, mutation and selection. Each potential solution, or individual in the population, represents a set of routes for all salesmen. Fitness functions are defined to evaluate solutions based on the total travel time, adherence to time windows and response to real-time traffic and route cancellations. GAs iteratively evolve the population towards better solutions by selecting high-fitness individuals to reproduce, crossing over their routes to generate new offspring, and introducing mutations to maintain genetic diversity. This method is particularly effective for finding near-optimal solutions quickly in complex, dynamic scenarios such as the mTSPTW, where traditional methods might falter due to computational infeasibility."
